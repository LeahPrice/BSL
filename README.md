# BSL
Bayesian synthetic likelihood (BSL, Price et al (2018)) is an alternative to standard, non-parametric approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). BSL assumes a multivariate normal distribution for the summary statistic likelihood and it is suitable when the distribution of the model summary statistics is sufficiently regular.
