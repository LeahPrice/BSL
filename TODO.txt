- It would be nice to allow functionality for users to have the option of write their own function
to produce the n model simulations (rather than 1). There are some simpler models where the n
simulations can be generated say using vectorised code (eg g-and-k example), which would be much
faster than a (parallel or serial) for loop.

- Adjust code so that the fnPrior function returns the log value.

- Add a sentence in bsl function help page, "See \code{\link{ma2}}, \code{\link{cell}} and \code{\link{mgnk}} for examples."
